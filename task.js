Task 1
Import object user1 and write a function that will check if the phone number for every user is a digit
Result:
- if the phone number is a digit then log true
- if the phone number is not a digit then log which user's phone number is not a digit
something like: "Phone number of User with ID 2 is not a digit"

Task 2
Import objects user1 and user2 (this one is a js file, object is assigned to an exported const) and compare them
Result:
- if the users1 first email address is the same as users2 first email address (users1.users[1].emailAddress === users2.users[1].emailAddress) then do not log anything
- if the users1 first email address is not the same as users2 first email address then log that information
something like: "email address of user with ID 2 differs between user1 and user2 objects. User1: ${user1 email address}; user2: ${user2 email address}"
compare email addresses, first names, last names and phone numbers
